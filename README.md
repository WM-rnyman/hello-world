hello-world
===========

A repository for exploration.  As wide as the world and full of random stuff.  How much is enough in a README?  Is this everything I need to say to get this done?

For now, yes.

But now I have created a new branch.  that is exciting!  I am branching this code base to add these lines to the README file.  Seems excessive, but what the heck.  I only GIT once!
